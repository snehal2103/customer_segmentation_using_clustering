# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm to classify customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending behavior. The purpose of this segmentation is to enable businesses to target different customer groups with tailored marketing strategies and offers.

# Project Overview
In this project, a KMeans clustering model is applied to a dataset containing customer information, including Annual Income and Spending Score. The model is trained to find natural customer segments, helping businesses understand different spending behaviors and financial capacities.


# Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web interface.

numpy: For handling numerical operations.

matplotlib: For visualizing customer segments and clustering results.

scikit-learn: For applying the KMeans clustering algorithm.
